## Account_Demo
It's a Lightning Record Page for Account with several items highlighted in the presentation.

## myComponent
This is a simple concept implementation of a "container" component that conditionally shows a plain record view form.  A few ways to extend its functionality
* embedding other components - standard or custom
* making the visibility condition more admin friendly, for instance, by referencing Custom Metadata
* making the visibility condition more generic, for instance, by allowing dependency injection (controller class) using Custom Metadata
